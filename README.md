# Assembly-Language-Temperature-and-Humidity-Display-System

Assembly Language Temperature and Humidity Display System:
Used serial communication to read temperature and humidity sensor from DHT11 sensor with AVR128DB48 microcontroller. Temperature data is displayed
on a seven-segment display and pushbutton is used to switch display mode between humidity percentage, temperature in celsius, and temperature in 
fahrenheit. Written entirely in assembly language, uses subroutines, timer counters, and  interrupts.
